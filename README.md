## 🔍 Project Overview

This case study invites you to explore how presidential rhetoric shapes national discourse. Specifically, you'll investigate whether **Democratic and Republican presidents differ in their use of unifying vs. polarizing language** during inaugural addresses.

Using real-world text data scraped from the UCSB American Presidency Project, you’ll apply core data science skills including:

- Web scraping
- Feature engineering with text
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Logistic regression modeling
- Bias and uncertainty reflection

Your goal is to **reproduce this analysis** and reflect on what your findings suggest about the relationship between language and political identity.
